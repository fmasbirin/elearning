# Basic course search

This plugin simply displays Moodle's course search form in a block. With the advent of global search, we wanted to give admins a quick way of searching for course titles or codes without having to wade through course content.

This block can be added to the site homepage or to the dashboard.

Because it uses the core course renderer to output the form, you can override the layout in your theme.
